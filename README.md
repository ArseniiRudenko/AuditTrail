# Audit Trail plugin for Leantime.

For Leantime version 3.x and above.

Provides new 'History' tab in To-Do item, that shows change history for the current item.
Very useful for long living To-Do items, or To-Do items that require collaboration and change hands(assigned person) frequently.
With history you can just reassign same story to the next collaborator and still have the trail of who worked on it and who moved it to which status.
